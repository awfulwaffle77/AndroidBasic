# AndroidBasic

This application implements basic functionalities. 

It uses Custom Adapters for ListViews, uses Firebase and local SQLDatabase,
uses Canvas to draw rectangles on top a video, parses JSON, and also uses the
GSON library and uses [MPChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart)
to draw a BarChart with custom colors.

Sadly, the code has almost no comments. Use at your own discretion.

The Firebase database looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/kexI8gA.png).
